We would like to draw your attention to some updated files that were provided for the hackathon. After looking over user comments, we've noticed that some people had issues with the first two zip files, no_pii_action_history.zip and no_pii_grievance.zip for Problem statement 1 and 2. Since these files were originally MongoDB dumps, we are aware that certain users were having trouble decoding JSON.

We have uploaded the new versions of these datafiles (with the same data) for the users who faced the above issue. no_pii_action_history_v2.zip and no_pii_grievance_v2.zip are the new names for the revised files. As both the version datafiles have the same data, you can decide whether to use the updated versions of the files or to keep using the original ones. Should you choose to use the updated files, please make sure that your code is updated appropriately. Please mention which version of the files you are using in the readme file in your repository.

Furthermore, it was discovered that the third file, CategoryCode_Mapping.xlsx, contained some missing mappings. A new version of this file has been added named CategoryCode_Mapping_v2.xlsx, which is the one you can use going forward. In the earlier excel file there were multiple sheets named Complaint Category, Input Fields, ComplaintCategory-InputFieldMap, Movement Mapping, Fixed Destination. Some of these contained redundant information which may not have been useful for the hackathon and thus have been removed from the new one.

Also find the details of each attribute in the excel files named attribute_details.xlsx

Kindly use the same link to obtain the revised files which was used to obtain the actual files in the first place, and add them to your projects as needed. Please contact us if you have any questions or if you run into any more problems.

We appreciate your cooperation and understanding.
